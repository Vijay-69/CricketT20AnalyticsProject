### Data Sources

I used bright data web scraping to collect data from espncricinfo website then performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas.
The raw data is converted to json files and then after that to csv files. Using these csv files the dashboard building part is done using Power BI.

### Tools

-> Data cleaning and transformation in Python Pandas
-> Data transformation in Power Query
-> Data modeling and building parameters using DAX
-> Build dashboard in Power BI

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall performance of a particular player ?
- What are the statistics from previous matches on the basis of which a person can be selected for top 11 ?
- What are the strengths/weakness/requirements of individual in bowling/batting/Alrounder category ?
